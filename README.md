This is a limited automated slider (color, spacing and blur) that change the image characteristics!
I've learned from here: 
- if you have variables and inputs with type, name and dataset-if necessary- you can control the values in real time!
- change and mousemove are events that complement eachother for more interaction;
- the variables are covered in a document with --${} ;
- document.documentElement plays the role of changing the value;
- very genuine idea to use the same name of the input for variables, that way you can controll all three by just putting `--${this.name}` !!
